The backend is built using Spring Boot, providing a REST API for managing to-do items. The frontend is built using React, providing a user interface for interacting with the API. To-do items are stored in memory (ephemeral). Each to-do item includes a description, due date, priority, and category.\n5: \n6: ## Goals\n7: - User can add a new to-do item with a description, due date, priority, and category via the React UI.\n8: - User can view a list of all to-do items in the React UI.\n9: - User can mark a to-do item as complete via the React UI.\n10: - User can delete a to-do item via the React UI.\n11: - The Spring Boot backend provides a REST API to support the React UI functionality.\n12: \n13: ## Non-Goals\n14: - User authentication and authorization.\n15: - Persistent storage of to-do items (e.g., using a database).\n16: - Advanced filtering or sorting of to-do items.\n17: - User accounts or profiles.\n18: - Real-time updates (e.g., using WebSockets).\n19: \n20: ## Components\n21: \n22: ### ToDoItem Model\n23: **Responsibility:** Represents a to-do item with properties like description, due date, priority, category, and completion status.\n24: \n25: **Affected Files:**\n26: - `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/model/ToDoItem.java`\n27: \n28: **Behavior Expectations:**\n29: - The ToDoItem class should have fields for id (Long), description (String), dueDate (LocalDate), priority (String), category (String), and completed (boolean).\n30: - The ToDoItem class should have appropriate getters and setters for all fields.\n31: - The ToDoItem class should have a constructor that accepts description, dueDate, priority, and category as arguments.\n32: - Priority should be an enum with values HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.\n33: - Category should be a String.\n34: \n35: **Integration Points:**\n36: - Used by the ToDoService for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting to-do items.\n37: - Returned by the ToDoController as part of the REST API responses.\n38: \n39: ### ToDoService\n40: **Responsibility:** Provides the business logic for managing to-do items, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them. Stores to-do items in an in-memory list.\n41: \n42: **Affected Files:**\n43: - `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/service/ToDoService.java`\n44: \n45: **Behavior Expectations:**\n46: - The ToDoService class should have methods for: - creating a new to-do item (createToDoItem) - retrieving all to-do items (getAllToDoItems) - retrieving a to-do item by ID (getToDoItemById) - updating a to-do item (updateToDoItem) - deleting a to-do item (deleteToDoItem)\n47: - The ToDoService should use an in-memory list (ArrayList) to store the to-do items.\n48: - The createToDoItem method should generate a unique ID for each new to-do item.\n49: - The updateToDoItem method should update the properties of an existing to-do item.\n50: - The deleteToDoItem method should remove a to-do item from the in-memory list.\n51: - The getToDoItemById method should return null if no item with the given ID exists.\n52: \n53: **Integration Points:**\n54: - Used by the ToDoController to handle REST API requests.\n55: - Uses the ToDoItem model to represent to-do items.\n56: \n57: ### ToDoController\n58: **Responsibility:** Handles REST API requests for managing to-do items.\n59: \n60: **Affected Files:**\n61: - `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/controller/ToDoController.java`\n62: \n63: **Behavior Expectations:**\n64: - The ToDoController should have endpoints for: - creating a new to-do item (POST /api/todos) - retrieving all to-do items (GET /api/todos) - retrieving a to-do item by ID (GET /api/todos/{id}) - updating a to-do item (PUT /api/todos/{id}) - deleting a to-do item (DELETE /api/todos/{id})\n65: - The ToDoController should use the ToDoService to perform the business logic.\n66: - The ToDoController should return appropriate HTTP status codes for each request (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).\n67: - The ToDoController should serialize and deserialize ToDoItem objects to/from JSON.\n68: - The POST /api/todos endpoint should return the created ToDoItem with its generated ID.\n69: - The PUT /api/todos/{id} endpoint should return 404 if the item does not exist.\n70: - The DELETE /api/todos/{id} endpoint should return 404 if the item does not exist.\n71: \n72: **Integration Points:**\n73: - Exposes the REST API for the React frontend.\n74: - Uses the ToDoService to manage to-do items.\n75: - Uses the ToDoItem model to represent to-do items.\n76: \n77: ### React Frontend\n78: **Responsibility:** Provides a user interface for interacting with the Spring Boot REST API to manage to-do items.\n79: \n80: **Affected Files:**\n81: - `src/main/js/App.js`\n82: - `src/main/js/components/ToDoList.js`\n83: - `src/main/js/components/ToDoItem.js`\n84: - `src/main/js/components/ToDoForm.js`\n85: \n86: **Behavior Expectations:**\n87: - The App.js component should be the main entry point for the React application.\n88: - The ToDoList.js component should display a list of to-do items retrieved from the API.\n89: - The ToDoItem.js component should display a single to-do item and allow the user to mark it as complete or delete it.\n90: - The ToDoForm.js component should allow the user to add a new to-do item.\n91: - The React frontend should use the Fetch API or Axios to make requests to the Spring Boot REST API.\n92: - The React frontend should handle errors gracefully (e.g., displaying an error message to the user).\n93: - The React frontend should update the UI automatically when to-do items are added, updated, or deleted.\n94: - The due date should be displayed in a user-friendly format.\n95: - The priority should be displayed as High, Medium, or Low.\n96: - The category should be displayed as a string.\n97: \n98: **Integration Points:**\n99: - Consumes the REST API exposed by the ToDoController.\n100: - Displays to-do items to the user and allows them to interact with them.\n101: \n102: ### Configuration\n103: **Responsibility:** Configures the Spring Boot application, including setting the port and enabling CORS.\n104: \n105: **Affected Files:**\n106: - `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/config/WebConfig.java`\n107: \n108: **Behavior Expectations:**\n109: - The WebConfig class should enable CORS to allow requests from the React frontend (running on a different port).\n110: - The WebConfig class should set the port to 8080 (or another suitable port).\n111: - The configuration should be done using annotations (e.g., @Configuration, @EnableWebMvc, @CrossOrigin).\n112: \n113: **Integration Points:**\n114: - Used by the Spring Boot application to configure its behavior.\n115: \n116: ## Technical Requirements\n117: - Spring Boot for the backend.\n118: - React for the frontend.\n119: - Java 17 or higher.\n120: - Maven or Gradle for dependency management.\n121: - REST API design principles.\n122: - CORS enabled on the backend to allow requests from the frontend.\n123: - JSON for data serialization and deserialization.\n124: - Use LocalDate for due dates.\n125: - Use an enum for priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).\n126: - Code should be well-documented and follow standard Java and JavaScript coding conventions.\n127: - Use functional components and hooks in React.\n128: \n129: ## Edge Cases\n130: - Empty to-do list: The React frontend should display a message indicating that there are no to-do items.\n131: - Invalid input: The React frontend should validate user input and display appropriate error messages if the input is invalid (e.g., missing description, invalid due date).\n132: - API errors: The React frontend should handle API errors gracefully and display an error message to the user.\n133: - Non-existent to-do item: The ToDoController should return a 404 Not Found error if the user tries to retrieve, update, or delete a to-do item that does not exist.\n134: - Long descriptions: The React frontend should handle long descriptions gracefully (e.g., by truncating them or wrapping them).\n135: - Null values: The backend should handle null values for optional fields (e.g., category) gracefully.\n136: \n137: ## Acceptance Criteria\n138: - [ ] When I add a new to-do item via the React UI, it should be displayed in the to-do list.\n139: - [ ] When I mark a to-do item as complete via the React UI, its status should be updated in the UI.\n140: - [ ] When I delete a to-do item via the React UI, it should be removed from the to-do list.\n141: - [ ] When I refresh the page, the to-do list should still contain the same items (since it's in-memory).\n142: - [ ] When the API returns an error, the React UI should display an appropriate error message.\n143: - [ ] When I enter invalid data in the to-do form, the React UI should display validation errors.\n144: - [ ] When I try to access a non-existent to-do item via the API, I should receive a 404 Not Found error.\n145: - [ ] When the to-do list is empty, the React UI should display a message indicating that there are no to-do items.\n146: \n```\n\n### /workspace/SPEC.md\n```markdown\n1: # Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application with React Frontend and Spring Boot Backend\n2: \n3: ## Overview\n4: This project implements a simple to-do list application.
