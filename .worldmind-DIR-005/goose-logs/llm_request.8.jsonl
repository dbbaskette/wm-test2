generate a unique ID for each new to-do item.\n- The updateToDoItem method should update the properties of an existing to-do item.\n- The deleteToDoItem method should remove a to-do item from the in-memory list.\n- The getToDoItemById method should return null if no item with the given ID exists.\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Used by the ToDoController to handle REST API requests.\n- Uses the ToDoItem model to represent to-do items.\n\n### ToDoController\n**Responsibility:** Handles REST API requests for managing to-do items.\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/controller/ToDoController.java`\n\n**Behavior Expectations:**\n- The ToDoController should have endpoints for: - creating a new to-do item (POST /api/todos) - retrieving all to-do items (GET /api/todos) - retrieving a to-do item by ID (GET /api/todos/{id}) - updating a to-do item (PUT /api/todos/{id}) - deleting a to-do item (DELETE /api/todos/{id})\n- The ToDoController should use the ToDoService to perform the business logic.\n- The ToDoController should return appropriate HTTP status codes for each request (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).\n- The ToDoController should serialize and deserialize ToDoItem objects to/from JSON.\n- The POST /api/todos endpoint should return the created ToDoItem with its generated ID.\n- The PUT /api/todos/{id} endpoint should return 404 if the item does not exist.\n- The DELETE /api/todos/{id} endpoint should return 404 if the item does not exist.\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Exposes the REST API for the React frontend.\n- Uses the ToDoService to manage to-do items.\n- Uses the ToDoItem model to represent to-do items.\n\n### React Frontend\n**Responsibility:** Provides a user interface for interacting with the Spring Boot REST API to manage to-do items.\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- `src/main/js/App.js`\n- `src/main/js/components/ToDoList.js`\n- `src/main/js/components/ToDoItem.js`\n- `src/main/js/components/ToDoForm.js`\n\n**Behavior Expectations:**\n- The App.js component should be the main entry point for the React application.\n- The ToDoList.js component should display a list of to-do items retrieved from the API.\n- The ToDoItem.js component should display a single to-do item and allow the user to mark it as complete or delete it.\n- The ToDoForm.js component should allow the user to add a new to-do item.\n- The React frontend should use the Fetch API or Axios to make requests to the Spring Boot REST API.\n- The React frontend should handle errors gracefully (e.g., displaying an error message to the user).\n- The React frontend should update the UI automatically when to-do items are added, updated, or deleted.\n- The due date should be displayed in a user-friendly format.\n- The priority should be displayed as High, Medium, or Low.\n- The category should be displayed as a string.\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Consumes the REST API exposed by the ToDoController.\n- Displays to-do items to the user and allows them to interact with them.\n\n### Configuration\n**Responsibility:** Configures the Spring Boot application, including setting the port and enabling CORS.\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- `src/main/java/com/example/todolist/config/WebConfig.java`\n\n**Behavior Expectations:**\n- The WebConfig class should enable CORS to allow requests from the React frontend (running on a different port).\n- The WebConfig class should set the port to 8080 (or another suitable port).\n- The configuration should be done using annotations (e.g., @Configuration, @EnableWebMvc, @CrossOrigin).\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Used by the Spring Boot application to configure its behavior.\n\n## Technical Requirements\n- Spring Boot for the backend.\n- React for the frontend.\n- Java 17 or higher.\n- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.\n- REST API design principles.\n- CORS enabled on the backend to allow requests from the frontend.\n- JSON for data serialization and deserialization.\n- Use LocalDate for due dates.\n- Use an enum for priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).\n- Code should be well-documented and follow standard Java and JavaScript coding conventions.\n- Use functional components and hooks in React.\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Empty to-do list: The React frontend should display a message indicating that there are no to-do items.\n- Invalid input: The React frontend should validate user input and display appropriate error messages if the input is invalid (e.g., missing description, invalid due date).\n- API errors: The React frontend should handle API errors gracefully and display an error message to the user.\n- Non-existent to-do item: The ToDoController should return a 404 Not Found error if the user tries to retrieve, update, or delete a to-do item that does not exist.\n- Long descriptions: The React frontend should handle long descriptions gracefully (e.g., by truncating them or wrapping them).\n- Null values: The backend should handle null values for optional fields (e.g., category) gracefully.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] When I add a new to-do item via the React UI, it should be displayed in the to-do list.\n- [ ] When I mark a to-do item as complete via the React UI, its status should be updated in the UI.\n- [ ] When I delete a to-do item via the React UI, it should be removed from the to-do list.\n- [ ] When I refresh the page, the to-do list should still contain the same items (since it's in-memory).\n- [ ] When the API returns an error, the React UI should display an appropriate error message.\n- [ ] When I enter invalid data in the to-do form, the React UI should display validation errors.\n- [ ] When I try to access a non-existent to-do item via the API, I should receive a 404 Not Found error.\n- [ ] When the to-do list is empty, the React UI should display a message indicating that there are no to-do items.\n\nNOTE: Output was 168 lines, showing only the last 100 lines.\n\n- The ToDoService should use an in-memory list (ArrayList) to store the to-do items.\n- The createToDoItem method should
